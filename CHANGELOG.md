All notable decisions and changes to this project are documented here.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### Major Technical Decisions

#### 1. File Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Use local filesystem storage with Multer instead of GridFS.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation for files under 16MB
- Better performance for small to medium files
- Easier to implement streaming and caching
- GridFS adds complexity without significant benefit for typical use case
- Can migrate to GridFS later if file sizes exceed 16MB regularly

**Trade-offs**:
- Limited to 16MB MongoDB document size for metadata
- Requires separate backup strategy for uploaded files
- Not suitable for very large files (>100MB)

**Future consideration**: If average file size exceeds 10MB or storage grows beyond 10GB, consider migrating to GridFS or S3-compatible storage.

---

#### 2. Font Selection
**Decision**: Use system font stack instead of custom web fonts.

**Rationale**:
- Figma design uses custom fonts that may require licensing
- System fonts provide excellent performance (no download required)
- Modern system fonts (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto) are high quality
- Reduces initial page load time by ~50-100KB
- Maintains professional appearance across platforms

**Implementation**:
```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 
             'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
```

**Trade-offs**:
- Slight deviation from Figma design
- Font rendering varies slightly across operating systems
- No unique brand typography

**Alternative**: If brand identity requires specific fonts, consider:
- Self-hosting fonts (add ~100KB to bundle)
- Using Google Fonts with font-display: swap
- Purchasing commercial font license

---

#### 3. Color Palette Extraction
**Decision**: Extract and standardize colors from Figma design tokens.

**Implementation**:
- Primary (Forest Green): `#2D5016` - Navigation, headers, CTAs
- Secondary (Earth Brown): `#8B4513` - Accents, borders
- Accent (Gold): `#FFD700` - Highlights, hover states
- Background (Beige): `#F5F5DC` - Page backgrounds
- Text Primary: `#1A1A1A` - Body text
- Text Secondary: `#666666` - Captions, metadata
- Success: `#10B981` - Success messages
- Error: `#EF4444` - Error states
- Warning: `#F59E0B` - Warnings

**Rationale**:
- Ensures visual consistency with Figma
- Provides semantic color naming for maintainability
- Supports dark mode implementation in future

---

#### 4. Responsive Breakpoints
**Decision**: Use Tailwind's default breakpoints with custom additions.

**Breakpoints**:
- `sm`: 640px (Mobile landscape)
- `md`: 768px (Tablet portrait)
- `lg`: 1024px (Tablet landscape / Small desktop)
- `xl`: 1280px (Desktop)
- `2xl`: 1536px (Large desktop)

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with industry standards
- Covers 99% of device sizes
- Matches Figma design frames (375px, 768px, 1440px)

---

#### 5. Animation Strategy
**Decision**: Use CSS transitions and transforms instead of JavaScript animation libraries.

**Rationale**:
- Better performance (GPU accelerated)
- Smaller bundle size (no additional libraries)
- Sufficient for current design requirements
- Easier to maintain and debug

**Implementation**:
- Hover effects: `transition-all duration-300`
- Modal animations: CSS transforms with opacity
- Loading states: CSS keyframe animations
- Page transitions: React Router with CSS transitions

**Trade-offs**:
- Complex animations from Figma may be simplified
- No timeline-based animation control
- Limited easing function options

**Future consideration**: If complex animations are required, consider Framer Motion (~30KB) or React Spring (~20KB).

---

#### 6. State Management
**Decision**: Use React hooks (useState, useContext) instead of Redux or Zustand.

**Rationale**:
- Application state is relatively simple
- No complex state sharing across many components
- Reduces bundle size by ~15KB
- Faster development and easier onboarding
- Custom hooks provide sufficient abstraction

**State structure**:
- Local state: Component-specific UI state
- Context: User authentication, theme preferences
- Server state: React Query for API data (considered for future)

**Trade-offs**:
- May need refactoring if app complexity grows
- No built-in dev tools for state debugging
- Prop drilling for deeply nested components

**Future consideration**: If state management becomes complex (>10 shared states), consider Zustand (~1KB) for its simplicity.

---

#### 7. API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API with JSON responses and standard HTTP methods.

**Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/files           - Upload file
GET    /api/files           - List files (paginated)
GET    /api/files/:id       - Get file metadata
GET    /api/files/:id/download - Download file
DELETE /api/files/:id       - Delete file
```

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard, well understood
- Easy to document and test
- Compatible with all HTTP clients
- Simple to cache and optimize

**Trade-offs**:
- Not as flexible as GraphQL for complex queries
- May require multiple requests for related data
- No real-time updates (would need WebSockets)

---

#### 8. File Validation
**Decision**: Whitelist approach for file types with size limits.

**Allowed types**:
- Images: JPEG, PNG, JPG
- Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Max size: 10MB (configurable)

**Rationale**:
- Security: Prevents malicious file uploads
- Performance: Limits storage and bandwidth usage
- User experience: Clear error messages for invalid files

**Implementation**:
- Server-side validation (primary)
- Client-side validation (UX enhancement)
- MIME type checking
- File extension verification
- Magic number validation (future enhancement)

---

#### 9. Error Handling
**Decision**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints.

**Format**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "File size exceeds maximum allowed size",
    "details": {
      "maxSize": "10MB",
      "receivedSize": "15MB"
    }
  }
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Predictable error handling on frontend
- Easier debugging and logging
- Better user experience with specific error messages
- Supports internationalization

---

#### 10. Pagination Strategy
**Decision**: Offset-based pagination with page and limit parameters.

**Implementation**:
```
GET /api/files?page=1&limit=12
```

**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Works well for small to medium datasets
- Allows direct page access (e.g., page 5)
- Sufficient for current requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance degrades with very large datasets
- Inconsistent results if data changes during pagination
- Not suitable for infinite scroll with frequent updates

**Future consideration**: If dataset exceeds 10,000 items or requires infinite scroll, consider cursor-based pagination.

---

#### 11. Security Measures
**Implemented**:
- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS restricted to client origin
- File type validation (whitelist)
- Filename sanitization
- Rate limiting (future enhancement)
- Input validation with express-validator
- MongoDB injection protection via Mongoose

**Not implemented** (future enhancements):
- Authentication/Authorization (JWT)
- API rate limiting
- File scanning for malware
- Encrypted file storage
- Audit logging

---

#### 12. Accessibility (a11y)
**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline.

**Implementation**:
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Alt text for images
- Color contrast ratios â‰¥ 4.5:1
- Screen reader friendly error messages

**Testing**:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS)
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- axe DevTools validation

---

#### 13. Performance Optimizations
**Implemented**:
- Code splitting with React.lazy
- Image lazy loading
- Memoization for expensive computations
- Debounced search inputs
- Optimized bundle size (~150KB gzipped)

**Future enhancements**:
- Service Worker for offline support
- Image optimization pipeline (WebP, AVIF)
- CDN for static assets
- Database indexing for queries
- Redis caching for API responses

---

#### 14. Development Workflow
**Decision**: Monorepo with npm workspaces.

**Rationale**:
- Shared dependencies between client and server
- Easier version management
- Simplified deployment pipeline
- Single repository for related code

**Trade-offs**:
- Slightly more complex initial setup
- Requires understanding of workspace structure
- Larger repository size

**Alternative considered**: Separate repositories (polyrepo) - rejected due to increased maintenance overhead.

---

#### 15. Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Manual testing for MVP, with test infrastructure ready for future.

**Future testing plan**:
- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- Integration tests: Supertest for API
- E2E tests: Playwright or Cypress
- Coverage target: 80% for critical paths

**Rationale**:
- Faster initial development
- Test infrastructure in place for future
- Focus on core functionality first
